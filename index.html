                    Graphic Content: Drawing as Method is a two-day conference open to the public that brings together a group of scholars whose research uses techniques of design representation 
                    to explore contemporary topics in the built environment. Their work makes a powerful case that research methods employing graphic production communicate findings in uniquely effective ways, establish expanded forms of agency, and illuminate unanticipated pathways of inquiry.

Educated at Columbia University and ETH Zürich, he previously practiced with Diller + Scofidio; and taught at the AA London, BAS, and the ETH. His research addresses contemporary urban and architectural conditions, exploring themes such as: the spatial transformations of Nordic welfare systems; social and environmental sustainability within urban and regional settings; the urban implications of demographic transformation; and problems related to the securitization of public space. Common to this work is the analytical and communicative role drawing plays.

She is interested in modes of spatial representation, particularly in relation to the digital and the limits of witnessing as a form of ethical engagement with distant places. Currently, she leads the project, Topological Atlas, which aims to produce visual counter-geographies of the fragile movements of migrants as they encounter the security apparatus of the border. She is Senior Research Fellow at the Borders & Territories group at the Faculty of Architecture, TU Delft. Her book, <em<Diasporic Agencies</em> (Routledge, 2016) addressed the subject of how architecture and urbanism can respond to the consequences of increasing migration. She has also addressed alternative modes of architectural production in the co-authored book <em>Spatial Agency</em> (Routledge, 2011) and the co-edited book <em>Trans-Local-Act</em> (aaa-peprav, 2011).
